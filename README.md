# DouBOL-Dash
An upcoming editor for Mario Kart: Double Dash!! track files, and possibly more!

# How to use
You basically need to have Visual Studio installed. I built this one with VS2015, but I don't think this will make much of a difference.

Or you can just run the EXE found in /bin. Currently if you save your work, you have to manually insert the 0x1A bytes back into the beginning of the BOL file.

# Special Thanks
I'd like to thank Chadderz for the EndianBinaryReader library found in System/IO, which allows for Big Endian Binary reading. :)
